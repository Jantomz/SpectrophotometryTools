## Introduction

This repository is created for the Ottawa Regional Science Fair and aims to provide a collection of tools that can be used for processing spectrophotometry data. The tools included in this repository are designed to help visualize, manipulate, and create data in various formats.

## Data Point Naming Scheme

The data point naming scheme used in this repository follows the format: `rock_[magnification]_[version]_[sample-num]`. This naming convention helps to organize and identify different data points based on their magnification, version, and sample number.

magnification: a multiplier value to increase variation in data
version: a version of the dataset that is randomly varied
sample-num: the index of the data within the dataset

## Mineral Indexes

The minerals are each given an index as their classification, this is based off alphabetical order:

0 - Biotite
1 - Calcite
2 - Fluorite
3 - Galena
4 - Hematite
5 - Quartz

## Usage

To use the tools in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific tool you want to use.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the tool's documentation to install any dependencies and run the tool.
